# Adaptive Mesh Refinement 

We will demonstrate how GitHub Actions can be used to display a spectrogram of a snippet from an underwater audio stream.

* [`.github/workflows/Python_env.yml`](https://github.com/anurag-bha/AdaptiveFiniteElements/blob/main/.github/workflows/Python_env.yml)
* workflow steps:
  * upload figures to GitHub 

After the workflow is executed the adaptively refined mesh file is updated in the repo and is visualized below along with the deformed file
